# AWS Model Hosting — Mapping to Your 20‑Week Plan

**Generated:** 2025-09-15

## Weeks 5–8 (AWS / Bedrock)
- **Week 5 — Foundations & Setup** → Enable Bedrock access, set up IAM roles & guardrails. Small “Hello Bedrock” app comparing 2 models.
- **Week 6 — Agents & Function Calling** → Build a Bedrock **Agent** with 1–2 tools (Lambda functions) and guardrails; deploy behind API Gateway.
- **Week 7 — RAG** → Use **Knowledge Bases for Amazon Bedrock** or a vector DB (e.g., OpenSearch Serverless). Add evaluation & citations.
- **Week 8 — Multi‑modal / Summarization** → Pipeline with S3 + Textract OCR → Bedrock summarization; batch vs real‑time cost trade‑offs.

## Capstone (Weeks 17–20)
- Real‑time GenAI → Bedrock (serverless API).
- RAG store → Knowledge Bases (or OpenSearch/Pinecone) next to S3 docs.
- Observability → CloudWatch logs/metrics, X‑Ray traces; cost dashboards with CUR/CloudWatch.
